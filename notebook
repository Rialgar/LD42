Buy Items from sellers and store them untill a buyer wants to buy them. There will be many different items, so that storage place will be a limiting factor.

Can you deny buying stuff?
Can you deny selling stuff?
Can you destroy stuff in storage?
Upgrades for Storage Space, parallel queues?
Levels that change the number of items/store layout, or one endless game with difficulty curve?

Favourite for now:
    - no denying to buy things
    - no destroying things
    - buyers leave if not served in time
    - loose condition: 5 buyers leave
    - more different items over time, no win condition
